    "# For this project you will make a Blackjack game using Python. Click here to familiarize yourself with the the rules of the game. You won't be implementing\n",
    "# every rule \"down to the letter\" with the game, but we will doing a simpler version of the game. This assignment will be given to further test your\n",
    "# knowledge on object-oriented programming concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Rules:\n",
    "# 1. The game will have two players: the Dealer and the Player. The game will start off with a deck of 52 cards. The 52 cards will consist of 4 different suits:\n",
    "#       Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades. For each suit, there will be cards numbered 1 through 13.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#       Note: No wildcards will be used in the program\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 2. When the game begins, the dealer will shuffle the deck of cards, making them randomized. After the dealer shuffles, it will deal the player 2 cards and will deal\n",
    "#       itself 2 cards from. The Player should be able to see both of their own cards, but should only be able to see one of the Dealer's cards.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 3. The objective of the game is for the Player to count their cards after they're dealt. If they're not satisfied with the number, they have the ability to 'Hit'.\n",
    "#       A hit allows the dealer to deal the Player one additional card. The Player can hit as many times as they'd like as long as they don't 'Bust'. A bust is when\n",
    "#       the Player is dealt cards that total more than 21.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 4. If the dealer deals the Player cards equal to 21 on the first deal, the Player wins. This is referred to as Blackjack. Blackjack is NOT the same as getting cards\n",
    "#       that equal up to 21 after the first deal. Blackjack can only be attained on the first deal.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 5. The Player will never see the Dealer's hand until the Player chooses to 'stand'. A Stand is when the player tells the dealer to not deal it anymore cards.\n",
    "#       Once the player chooses to Stand, the Player and the Dealer will compare their hands. Whoever has the higher number wins. Keep in mind that the Dealer can\n",
